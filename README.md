if you enjoy the content, please give us a ‚≠ê on [github](https://github.com/schneiderl/zero-to-hero-interviewing)

this repository contains a compilation of study resources and Leetcode questions with the respective solutions that cover the main concepts asked during coding interviews.
the idea of the repository is to have a hands-on approach for interview questions.
explanations of data structures and algorithms will not go in-depth on how the subjects work. rather we choose to show examples on how to **make tem work** and **where are they best used at**.

problem solutions will be coded only in **python**, where as the examples of data structures and algoriths will be coded in **python**, **javascript** and **ruby**. each problem solution and subject explanation will contain a brief big o notation explanation as it is necessary when writing an optimal solution during an interview.

### study materials

## want to contribute? 

please do! anything is welcome: new question solutions, typo fixes, techniques/data structure page enhancements. 

_please be aware that this is in a very early phase, more content will be added in the future_
